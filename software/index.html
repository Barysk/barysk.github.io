                            I use <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> because it works better for my daily tasks, such as programming, gaming, and writing. One of its standout features is its excellent documentation, which I consider god-like in its detail, along with the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">AUR</a>. These resources make it incredibly easy to install software, eliminating the need to download shady installers from unreliable sources. Additionally, I use the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel" target="_blank">linux-zen kernel</a>, which is optimized for everyday tasks, providing better performance and stability.

                            I use <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html" target="_blank">Kitty</a> because it works seamlessly right out of the box.

                            I prefer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank">Bash</a> as my shell because it's simple and reliable and it just works.

                            I use <a href="https://hyprland.org/" target="_blank">Hyprland</a>, a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor, that is configured to match my old <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" target="_blank">dwm</a> workflow.

                            I love using <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">neovim</a>. However, as a fallback I use <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium</a> with the neovim plugin enabled.

                            I use <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> because it's very proactive in bringing gaming to Linux. I also use <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> for games that aren't available on Steam or Itch.io. While I like the idea of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">GOG Game Launcher</a>, I don't use it since it's not available on my operating system.

                            Currently I am learning <a href="https://odin-lang.org/" terget="_blank">Odin</a> and I am going to use it with <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html" target="_blank">Raylib</a>. I am keeping an eye for <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a>. I have experience using the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> engine, which was the first engine I learned. I chose it because it is the only fully-featured, open-source engine that is truly free, "as in freedom". Also I have some experience using <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html" target="_blank">Raylib</a> with C++ as well as Rust.

                            For music production, I am using <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/" target="_blank">Reaper</a> and <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. If you're looking for a good chiptune tracker, <a href="https://tildearrow.org/furnace/" target="_blank">Furnace</a> is an excellent option.

                            I rely on <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</a> because there is really no tool that can compete with it. If I had known about it earlier, I would have saved a ton of time.

                            For presentations, I now use <a href="https://github.com/Barysk/reiha" target="_blank">Reiha (レイハ)</a>. A tool I made, it can: display text, show media, and is edited through a plain text file. What else do you need? Well, if you want animations, you should choose something else... <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>? Or, since レイハ uses macroquad as a graphics library, you can fork the repo and implement GLSL shaders yourself ;)
