			<h1>Software and Hardware I Use</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p class="paragraph-default">In this section, I will provide information about the software and hardware I use, along with the reasons behind my choices.</p>
		</section>
		<hr>
		<section>
			<h2>Basic</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Operating System</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> because it works better for my daily tasks, such as programming, gaming, and writing. One of its standout features is its excellent documentation, which I consider god-like in its detail, along with the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">AUR</a>. These resources make it incredibly easy to install software, eliminating the need to download shady installers from unreliable sources. Additionally, I use the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel" target="_blank">linux-zen kernel</a>, which is optimized for everyday tasks, providing better performance and stability.</dd>
				<dt>Terminal Emulator</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html" target="_blank">Kitty</a> because it works seamlessly right out of the box.</dd>
				<dt>Shell</dt>
				<dd>I prefer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank">Bash</a> as my shell because it's simple and reliable and it just works.</dd>
				<dt>Window Manager / Desktop Environment</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" target="_blank">dwm</a>, a lightweight and precompiled window manager written in C. Like most tools I use, it’s simple and effective. For my status bar, I use <a href="https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks" target="_blank">dwmblocks</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Text Editor</dt>
				<dd>For most of my tasks, I rely on <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">neovim</a>. However, when simplicity is key, I switch to <a href="https://kate-editor.org/" target="_blank">Kate</a> or <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium</a>, with the neovim plugin enabled for consistency.</dd>
				<dt>Web Browser</dt>
				<dd><a href="https://librewolf.net/" target="_blank">Librewolf</a> is my go-to browser for everyday use, but I also have <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> installed as a backup in case something doesn’t work properly with Gecko.</dd>

			<h2>Utilities</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Gaming</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> because it's very proactive in bringing gaming to Linux. I also use <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> for games that aren't available on Steam or Itch.io. While I like the idea of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">GOG Game Launcher</a>, I don't use it since it's not available on my operating system.</dd>
				<dt>File manager</dt>
				<dd>I primarily use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunar" target="_blank">Thunar</a> along with the simple cd command for navigating directories</dd>
				<dt>Mail Client</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a> because it was easy to set up, but I'm considering switching to a terminal-based client like <a href="https://neomutt.org/" target="_blank">Neomutt</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Video Player</dt>
				<dd>Without a doubt, the best video player is <a href="https://mpv.io/" target="_blank">mpv</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Music/audio player</dt>
				<dd>I typically use mpv or just stream directly in the browser.</dd>
				<dt>Torrent Client</dt>
				<dd>I currently use <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/" target="_blank">qBittorrent</a>, but I'm planning to give <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/" target="_blank">Transmission</a> a try, as it looks interesting.</dd>

			<h2>Production</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>GameDev</dt>
				<dd>I have experience using the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> engine, which was the first engine I learned. I chose it because it is the only fully-featured, open-source engine that is truly free, "as in freedom." Now, I am transitioning to more low-level engines, such as <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html" target="_blank">Raylib</a> and <a href="https://www.tilengine.org/" target="_blank">Tilengine</a>, to enhance my C++ skills.</dd>
				<dt>Music</dt>
				<dd>For music production, I use <a href="https://lmms.io/" target="_blank">LMMS</a>, <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, and <a href="https://musescore.org/" target="_blank">Musescore</a>. If you're looking for a good chiptune tracker, <a href="https://tildearrow.org/furnace/" target="_blank">Furnace</a> is an excellent option.</dd> 
				<dt>Documents</dt>
				<dd>I rely on <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> because there’s really no tool that can compete with it. If I had known about it earlier, I would have saved a ton of time.</dd>
				<dt>Presentations</dt>
				<dd>For presentations, I use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/sent/" target="_blank">Sent by suckless</a>. It can display text, show media, and is edited through a simple text file—what more do you need?</dd>
				<dt>PDF viewer</dt>
				<dd>I use <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/" target="_blank">Zathura</a> for viewing PDFs.</dd>
				<dt>Image viewer</dt>
				<dd>My go-to image viewer is <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/" target="_blank">FEH</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Image modification</dt>
				<dd>For image editing, I use <a href="https://krita.org/" target="_blank">Krita</a> and <a href="https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama" target="_blank">Pixelorama</a>, but I'm planning to try <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> in the future.</dd>

			<h2>Hardware I Use</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Laptop</dt>
				<dd>I use a ThinkPad X220, which is fully capable of handling my everyday portable tasks.</dd>
				<dt>PC</dt>
				<dd>My desktop is an Acer NITRO, purchased for its great price-to-performance ratio. It features an RTX 3060, an 11th-gen i5 processor, and 16GB of RAM. I use the open-source NVIDIA driver, which works seamlessly with Xorg.</dd>
				<dt>Phone</dt>
				<dd>I have a Google Pixel 5 with GrapheneOS installed. I'm not particularly a fan of phones, but I do prioritize privacy.</dd>

			<h2>Things I don't use</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Things That Aren't Supported on Linux</dt>
				<dd>I mean, how could I?</dd>
				<dt>Epic Games Store</dt>
				<dd>Why am I making a separate section for it? I just want to. There have been statements from EGS that I find quite obscure. I believe their philosophy is harmful to game development. Plus, they don't offer any projects that interest me.</dd>
				<dt>Subscribtion Services</dt>
				<dd>I prefer owning my property rather than borrowing it.</dd>
