			<h1>Software and Hardware I use</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p class="paragraph-default">Here I will prowide inforamtion what software do I use and why.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Basic</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Operating System</dt>
				<dd>I use Arch Linux, since it works better for my daily tasks, such as programming, gaming and other text writing tasks, and has a feuture in face of god-like documentation and AUR which is incredible since there is now literally no reason to download any shady installers from internet. Also I use linux-zen kernel since it is optimized for everyday tasks.</dd>
				<dt>Terminal Emulator</dt>
				<dd>I use kitty since it just works out of the box.</dd>
				<dt>Shell</dt>
				<dd>I use bash as a shell. Since it is deadly simple and just works.</dd>
				<dt>Window Manager / Desktop Environment</dt>
				<dd>dwm. It is a precompiled wm written in C, as most of the things I use, it is simple and just works. As my status bar I use dwmblocks.</dd>
				<dt>Text Editor</dt>
				<dd>At most of my tasks I use neovim, but when it just simplier, I will use VSCodium, with neovim plugin of course.</dd>
				<dt>Web Browser</dt>
				<dd>Librewolf is my daily drive browser. But I have Brave installed just if something is not working right on Gecko.</dd>
			<dl>
			<hr>
			<h3>Utilities</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Gaming</dt>
				<dd>I use steam since it is very proactive in moving gaming to linux. Also I use lutris for games that I can't buy in steam or itch. I really like the idea of GOG Game Launcher but since I don't have this option on my operating system I don't use it.</dd>
				<dt>File manager</dt>
				<dd>Thunar and simple cd command ;)</dd>
				<dt>Mail Client</dt>
				<dd>Thunderbird since it was easy to setup, but I am planning to switch on something terminal based neomutt? idk yet.</dd>
				<dt>Music/audio player</dt>
				<dd>mpv or just in browser</dd>
				<dt>Video Player</dt>
				<dd>Of course the best one - mpv.</dd>
				<dt>Torrent Client</dt>
				<dd>qbittorrent, but transmission looks interesting I'll going to give it a try.</dd>
			<dl>
			<hr>
			<h3>Production</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>GameDev</dt>
				<dd>Godot since it is the only fully feutured engine that is fership of myree "as in freedom" and open sourced engine. Other engines i consider are mostly libraries for C++.</dd>
				<dt>Music</dt>
				<dd>Musescore, furnace, lmms.</dd>
				<dt>Documents</dt>
				<dd>LaTeX, there is really not much tools that can compete with it. If I only new this earlier, I'd saved a tonn of time.</dd>
				<dt>Presentations</dt>
				<dd>sent by suckless, it can show text, it can show media, and is edited through the txt file, what the hell else do you need?</dd>
				<dt>PDF viewer</dt>
				<dd>zathura.</dd>
				<dt>Image viewer</dt>
				<dd>feh</dd>
				<dt>Image modification</dt>
				<dd>Krita and Pixelorama, but going to try GIMP in future.</dd>
			<dl>
			<hr>
			<h3>Hardware I Use</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Laptop</dt>
				<dd>Thinkpad X220 that is fully capable to do my portable everyday things.</dd>
				<dt>PC</dt>
				<dd>Acer NITRO that was bought for its pretty fine price and comes with RTX 3060, 11th gen i5 and 16GB RAM. I use open sourced nvidia driver that works like a clock under xorg.</dd>
				<dt>Phone</dt>
				<dd>Google Pixel 5 with installed GraphineOS, I not a fan of phones, but kinda fan of privacy.</dd>
			<dl>
			<hr>
			<h3>Things I don't use</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Things that does not support linux</dt>
				<dd>I mean, how could I?</dd>
				<dt>EGS</dt>
				<dd>Why I am making a separate field for it? I just want to. There was some statements made by them I finding wery obscure, I think that their philosophy is poisonous for gamedev. And also they don't have any interesting projects for me.</dd>
				<dt>Subscribtion Services</dt>
				<dd>I love having ownership of my property, not borrowing it.</dd>
